There are a total of **17 freezing entries** delicately crafted by **17 skinners extraordinaire** among yours truly. While they have put forward their best craftsmanship, the task of choosing the coldest falls into your hands! Before casting your votes, be sure to check them all out by yourself in order to appreciate the effort put into them to the fullest.

We have listed all of these majestic icy-cold pieces of artistry inside our resident deep freezer, otherwise known as the one and only [completed skins compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/contests/2). You are highly encouraged to browse around and examine them thoroughly. Though, be sure to wear your gloves, as some of these might be the most frosty skins you'll ever see!

Should you find yourself overloaded with all that snow, don't worry because we have prepared showcase videos of each submission to help you digest them fully. Take a seat by the hearth and watch them all on the playlist below:

If you have your mind made up, head over to the [contest page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/137) and place the **3 stars** granted to you onto the submissions that gave you the most chills. But you have to be quick, because they may melt away in **2 weeks time**!
