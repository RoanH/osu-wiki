Celebrate 15 years of osu! by expressing your creativity through osu! skinning!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-05-08-skinning-contest-icons-of-an-era/banner.jpg)

A lot has happened in the 15 years since osu!'s inception — and every time the community thought that we have reached the top. Whether that'd be in mapping, skinning or gameplay, the boundaries of what is deemed possible kept getting pushed back further and further. Hopefully by going back through osu!'s rich history, or just recalling your personal favourite moments you will find something that inspires you to express yourself and share your work with the community!

As always, we are excited to see what the community can think up of with this contest's theme: **Icons of an Era**!

## Participation

As is tradition by this point, all skins have to be created from scratch and be aligned with the rules listed below!

Valid skin submissions must include a link to their forum thread in their [submission post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1612259). Said forum thread must be located in the [Work In Progress Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119) subforum.

Since all entries will have their respective forum threads publicly available, contestants and their submissions will not be anonymised. In fact, we encourage you to show off your work as much as you want!

## Voting

After the submission phase is over in roughly 35 days time (from the date of posting this article), the entries will be made available for community voting. Make sure to get involved when the time comes!

The voting will stay open for 14 days. Once that passes, the top 3 entries will become eligible for prizes as described below.

## Schedule

- Submission phase: **5** weeks starting from the release of this news post
- Voting phase: **2** weeks starting from a separate news post

## Rules

- Submissions must not contain inappropriate, malicious, or epileptic content, and should adhere to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules).
- All assets need to be created by yourself, or used with permission and proper credit to the authors. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - fonts
  - icons
  - textures
  - artworks (e.g. stock images or anime artwork)

- The majority of the in-game menu interface and at least two game modes have to be skinned. In other words, in addition to the gameplay elements, the following segments shouldn't be left default:
  - Ranking Panel
  - Song Selection
  - Mode Selection
  - Mod Icons
  - Pause and Fail Menu
  - Main Menu is optional, but highly encouraged
- Submissions must be new creations — only skins posted within the submission period will be accepted.
- Each submission must be accompanied by a forum thread in order to participate in the contest.
- Submissions must be made in time. Latecomers will not be accepted.
- Submissions must not be created as a part of, or be involved in a paid commission of any sort.
- Submissions must be created individually. Teams/collaborations are not allowed.
- Submissions must be in line with the given theme: "Icons of an Era".
- The file size for your .osk submission must be below 100 MB.
- Please submit a 16:9 image representing your skin, since this will be used as a cover on the contest page. This image must be at least 1280x720.

**Failure to comply with the contest rules may lead to disqualification, or, in severe cases, exclusion from future contests.**
