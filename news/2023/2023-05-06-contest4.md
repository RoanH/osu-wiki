Celebrate 15 years of osu! by expressing your creativity through osu! skinning!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-05-08-skinning-contest-icons-of-an-era/banner.jpg)

A lot has happened in the 15 years since osu!'s inception — and every time the community thought that we have reached the top. Whether that'd be in mapping, skinning or gameplay, the boundaries of what is deemed possible kept getting pushed back further and further. So without further ado, let's go over the theme.

## The theme

This year's theme — "**Icons of an Era**", aims to spark the community's imagination by creating art around various iconic osu! beatmaps that were crafted and risen to glory throughout osu!'s lifetime, as well as the many official osu! mascots that have been introduced over the course of the past 15 years. Whether your entry is focused around Taikonator or The Big Black, you will need to make sure that their presence is prominent, as anyone should be able to open your entry and almost immediately recognize what the inspiration behind your entry was.

Before you decide to take a journey through osu!'s history and come up with ideas, let's clear some ground rules, as well as the various schedules and prizes for the top entries!

## Participation

As is tradition by this point, all skins have to be created from scratch and be aligned with the rules listed below!

Valid skin submissions must include a link to their forum thread in their [submission post](TBD). Said forum thread must be located in the [Work In Progress Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/119) subforum.

Since all entries will have their respective forum threads publicly available, contestants and their submissions will not be anonymised. In fact, we encourage you to show off your work as much as you want!

## Voting

After the submission phase is over in roughly 35 days time (from the date of posting this article), the entries will be made available for community voting. Make sure to get involved when the time comes!

The voting will stay open for 14 days. Once that passes, the top 3 entries will become eligible for prizes as described below.

## Schedule
