# Code of conduct for modding and mapping

The **code of conduct for modding and mapping** is a set of rules and guidelines that apply to the entirety of the osu! [modding](/wiki/Modding) and [mapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) ecosystem and an extension to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) and [general ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria). In order to ensure that mapping and modding discussions in threads take place in a constructive, positive and productive environment, a code of conduct is crucial to get everyone on the same page. When participating in the modding and mapping ecosystem, it is mandatory to follow this code of conduct. Misconduct that violates these rules might lead to [penalties issued to your account](/wiki/Silence).

## Behaviour and conduct

- **The goal of modding is to help a mapper improve their work.** If you're not interested in helping people, steer clear of the discussion.
- **Consider what you're posting, why you're posting it, and who you're posting it to.** This will ensure your best intentions are conveyed and your post is easy to understand.
  - **Don't shy away from new mappers and modders** — these people are the ones who can benefit the most from your input! Be patient, understanding, and provide as much explanation as possible so that they can learn and improve more quickly.
  - **If you're new yourself, don't be afraid to say so!** This will allow more experienced community members to point you in the right direction. Everyone was new and in your position once!
- **Treat others as you wish to be treated.** People are more receptive to kind, helpful suggestions than hostile ones. Stay on topic and keep away from personal attacks, hateful comments, and misplaced jokes to avoid derailing the thread.
- **Use the [discussion page](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion).** Discuss your suggestions with other community members. Otherwise, it is unlikely your concerns will be heard by anyone with the power to address them appropriately.

## Responding to a mod

It's necessary to give a proper response to a mod post. Not only will it make it easier for future mods to be tailored to your concept or style, but it will also help the modder improve their modding ability.

In order for this exchange to be productive, it is important to consider the following:

- **Treat all suggestions as valid and equally important.** Don't draw hasty conclusions about the validity of a suggestion without properly assessing it.
- **Explain yourself as much as possible.** State what you changed, and if you didn't accept the suggestion for some reason, explain why and what you did instead.
- **Remain calm and professional.** Say what needs to be said in order to explain yourself and leave it at that. No matter how unhelpful the suggestion was, responding with hostility, sarcasm, etc. will not help the situation.
- **Provide context.** By providing concise explanations on the mods you responded to, you make it easier for future modders, [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators), and [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team) to revisit discussions during their checks.

## Further exchange and discussion

Sometimes, discussions will be drawn-out, and a single mod and response isn't enough to bring all parties to agreement. Perhaps the mapper doesn't agree with a suggestion, and the modder isn't satisfied with their response. Ideally, all discussions should find closure.

Consider exploring the following solutions when an agreement cannot be reached:

- **Ask if you're unsure about something.** Ask the person in question to explain what they meant. They should be more than willing to explain things to you in more detail.
- **Ask someone with more experience, such as a member of [BN](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) or [NAT](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team).** While they are busy people, they should be able to help you reach an agreement.
- **Being wrong can be far more valuable than being right.** If you realise there's a more suitable alternative to something you originally suggested, don't be afraid to put your pride aside.
- **There are no wrong opinions** — it's up to the mapper and modders to come to an agreement in a civil manner. Try to understand alternative points of view rather than attack them, as you never know when it might be useful in the future.
- **Take a break.** It is important to be at a right state of mind when discussing something. If you can't explain something through logic, you will not be able to explain it to them through violence either.
- **Report bad behaviour.** When things look to be getting out of hand, or if the discussion is struggling to stay on topic, [call a moderator](/wiki/Reporting_bad_behaviour). Don't contribute to the problem by continuing to post.
